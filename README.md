# Lending-club-data-Analysis

## Dataset Overview

Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending company that matches borrowers with investors through an online platform. It services people that need personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. Borrowers receive the full amount of the issued loan minus the origination fee, which is paid to the company. Investors purchase notes backed by the personal loans and pay Lending Club a service fee. The company shares data about all loans issued through its platform during certain time periods.

* **Dataset**: [Lending Club data](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action)
* **Years of data to download**: 2007-2011

The data contains 42538 rows and 145 columns. Not all these columns contain meaningful (or any) information so they need to be cleaned. The loans are categorized into different grades and sub-grades. It would be interesting to see whether they have any impact on the interest rates or not. The process should lead us into default prediction, and finding the columns that directly predict how the loan will behave. These would be our most important features.

**In this project data cleaning and exploration has been performed on Lending club dataset**.
